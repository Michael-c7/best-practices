O - Open/Closed Principle
---
WHAT:
have the ability to add new thing without having to make changes,
your program will automatically know what
to do without having to add additional code

Another way to put it...
should be open for extension, but closed for modification


- should break your code into
individual classes, functions, modules, ect...
