MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)


What:
Attempts to more clearly separate
the development of the
UI from the business logic
of you app




Models: hold information.

View: formats the data.

ViewModel: encapulates the business logic,
 an be considered a specialized Controller that acts as a data converter.
 It changes Model information into View information,
 passing commands from the View to the Model.

The only exception to this rule tends to be validation
and it’s considered acceptable for Models to validate data
being used to define or update existing models
(e.g does an e-mail address being input meet the
requirements of a particular regular expression?).


Views and ViewModels communicate using data-bindings and events.
ViewModel doesn’t just expose Model attributes but
also access to other methods and features such as validation.
